Loading Static files: If there exists a folder named static at the applicationâ€™s root level, that is, at the same level as run.py,

Alternatively, we can provide a parameter named static_folder to the application object while defining the application in hello_template/templates/__init__.py file

Making our web app modular with blueprints: A blueprint is a concept in Flask that helps make larger applications really modular. 
It is actually a set of operations that can be registered on an application and represents how to construct or build an application.
We will modify our views to work using blueprints.
